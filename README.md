#HB Final Project: Stretch Break Timer
1. Leave this page open as you work to get a reminder to stretch every X minutes. 
2. When the alert goes off, all your work will be pushed to the background and you will be shown a stretch tip.
3. You will see a random stretch tip every breaktime.

Mom always says:
> Don't forget to stretch!
